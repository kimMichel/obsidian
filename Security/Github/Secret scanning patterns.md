List of supported secrets and the partners that Github works with to prevent fraudulent use of secrets that were committed accidentally.

There are three types of secret scanning alerts:

- User alerts: Reported to users in the Security tab of the repository, when a supported secret is detected in the repository.
- Push protection alerts: Reported to users in the Security tab of the repository, when a contributor bypasses push protection.
- Partner alerts: Reported directly to secret providers that are part of secret scanning's partner program. These alerts are not reported in the Security tab of the repository.
