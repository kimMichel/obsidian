MITRE is a U.S. not-for-profit organization that does research and engineering mainly for the government, especially in national security, cybersecurity, aviation, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.

# Why security people care about MITRE

MITRE is behind a bunch of things you see daily in AppSec:

- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
	- MITRE manages the CVE program, the global ID system for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
	- The catalog of weakness types is also run by MITRE.
- MITRE ATT&CK
	- A knowledge base of attacker tactics and techniques used heavily in blue teaming, threat intel, SOC work, etc.

In practice:
- When your SAST/SCA/DAST tools show CWE IDs
- When your vuln scanner flags CVE-2024-XXXX
- When your blue-team folks talk about MITRE ATT&CK TTPs

all of that traces back to MITRE's work.
