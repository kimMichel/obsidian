A Red Team is a group of hackers with varying backgrounds that test the organization's infrastructure.

Attacks performed by Red Teams are divided into 3 groups:

- Cyber (Digital Attacks includes Web, Network & other Cloud technologies)
- Social Attacks (Exploiting people's behavior)
- Physical (Attacks involving physical man-power)

A Red Team operations is similar to a penetration test but is more targeted. One of the main goal of a Red Team is to test the organization's detection & response capabilities.

The attack performed by Red Team are similar to the attack techniques employed by Threat Actors having malicious intent.

- Red Team Emulation - Copy attack techniques of Threat actors (substitute)
- Red Team Simulation - Mimics behavior of Threat actors

A Red team will try to get in and access sensitive information in any way possible, as quietly as possible leaving no footprints behind.

The Real-World Attack Simulation by Red Team is for significantly improving the effectiveness of organization infrastructure.

Big enterprises like Microsoft and Defense agencies uses cyber Red Teams to conduct assessments on their own networks.

## Penetration Test vs Red Teaming

### Penetration Test

- An attack against a host, network or any application to measure and identify risks associated with the exploitation of a target environment.
- More emphasis on reducing exposed vulnerabilities.
- Scope is limited - 1 to 2 specific systems or networks.
- Makes assumptions about the environment, may not test where it isn't told to go.
- Uses tools present at that time during testing.

### Red Teaming

- Process of using real-world Tactics, Techniques employed by threat-actors having goals to measure the effectiveness of the people, technologies used to defend an environment.
- More emphasis on Training and measuring risks & defense capabilities of an organization.
- Specific part of (or the entire) organization.
- Makes no assumptions; attempts to compromise everywhere; pivots and changes strategy, techniques if/when needed.
- Constantly researching new exploits, vulnerabilities & implement attack with new tools as soon as it is discovered.
