Instead of relying on tool-based approaches, a Red Team develops unique attack situations leveraging manual and automated procedures.

Red Teams are trained to elude detection from one or more of the following security devices:

- CCTVs (close circuit television cameras)
- Keypad entry locks
- Wireless intercoms/video intercoms
- Motion/sensor detects
- Single or double deadbolts
- Door and window locks
- Steel security doors
- Remote entry gates
