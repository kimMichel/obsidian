Imagine that you're a developer with administrator permissions for a Github repository. You want to automate security checks. These steps help you analyze your releases for any vulnerabilities. Luckily, your organization purchased GHAS. Your GHAS license enables you to accomplish these tasks by using CodeQL.

CodeQL is a tool for analyzing the code in your Github repository and identifying security vulnerabilities. It's available for public repositories and private repositories that your organization owns. CodeQL supports many languages for analysis, including C/C++, Java, and Python.
