Github dependency management tools help you handle the security risks and maintenance requirements of incorporating third-party software into your project.

Imagine you're responsible for a Github project. This project is built on several other pieces of software, also known as dependencies. These dependencies provide necessary functionality, but they also require proper management. You want to keep your dependencies up to date, and also put processes in place to address any security risks or vulnerabilities that are introduced because you rely on software that's maintained outside of your project. You also want to automate this process and avoid delays in responding to important issues.

Luckily, Github provides you with dependency management tools that help to manage your dependencies and any vulnerabilities they might introduce. in this module, you'll learn about these tools.
